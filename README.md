# Atmega164-LED_MATRIX-PROJECT
UNI PROJECT 2 consists of creating a robot face that can express and change its emotions from sad to happy when it receives commands. The board of the MCU is still a work in progress for now.

!!!UPDATE:
Because of the limitations caused by the 20Mhz frequency of the oscillator, using loops is almost impossible (the signals require very strict delays of nanoseconds)
